\section{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}

The Vulnerability Test Suite Generator (VTSG) generates collections 
of vulnerable and non-vulnerable
synthetic programs expressing specific flaws.  
The programs can be
test cases to evaluate static analyzers. 
Each test case targets one flaw. There are two types of test cases:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item cases with flawed code (unsafe), leading to a vulnerability, and
  \item safe cases with similar behavior, but without the flaws, that is, no
	vulnerability.
\end{itemize}
Exactly corresponding vulnerable and non-vulnerable
cases could, in theory, be generated in pairs. However, since each test case
is generated separately, there is no exact correspondence between 
cases.

Figure~\ref{fig:cartesian product} suggests that just three sources of input,
two ways of filtering the input, four sinks, and two ways to execute the query
already yields 3 × 2 × 4 x 2 = 48
combinations.  Multiply that by many different kinds of bugs and all flow control
complexities with various conditions, then include ``scaffolding'' such as
initializing variables, importing libraries, and declaring functions to get an
idea of the work that VTSG may save.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig_cartesian_product.png}
  \caption{Just three sources of input, two ways of filtering, four sinks, and
    two query executions yield 48 possible test cases.}
  \label{fig:cartesian product}
\end{figure}

NIST's Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD) has suites of paired test cases in
the Juliet test suites for C/C++ and Java, which are available as SARD test suites
108 and 109.  These and many other test suites are available at
\href{https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/testsuite.php}
     {https://samate.nist.gov/ SARD/testsuite.php}.

The generator is written in Python 3.
The VTSG git repository is at
\href{https://github.com/usnistgov/VTSG}{https://github.com/ usnistgov/VTSG}.
The list of files and the README.md file are given in App.~\ref{gitContent}.


\subsection{History} 

Originally named Vulnerability Test Suite (VTS) generator, version 1 only
generated \CSharp\ programs. VTS version 2 generated PHP
programs~\cite{StivaletFongVTSPHP2016} in addition.  Version 2 was more
customizable to generate other programming languages.
VTSG version 3 systematically maintains indentation, so also
generates Python programs.
% VTSG produces manifest files in the Static Analysis Results Interchange Format
% (SARIF) Version 2.1.0~\cite{SARIF2.1.0} format.

Readers can download the PHP and \CSharp\ test cases generated 
by earlier versions as SARD test suites 103 and 105 from
\href{https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/testsuite.php}{https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/testsuite.php}.


\subsection{Install Supporting Packages}

\noindent The following instructions are provided for users who may not have these
packages already installed on their Linux machines. Users who already have these
packages may skip this section.

\noindent To download files from Github, first install the \emph{Git} package.
Here is the command to install it:

\begin{verbatim}
    sudo apt-get install git    
\end{verbatim}

\noindent VTSG is written in Python 3, so Python 3 must be installed, too.
Here is the command to install it:

\begin{verbatim}
    sudo apt-get install python3
\end{verbatim}

\noindent To download Python source code packages, install the \emph{pip
Python} package manager.
Here is the command to install it:

\begin{verbatim}
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
\end{verbatim}

\noindent One may also have to install the \emph{pip Python 3} package manager.
Here is the command to install it:

\begin{verbatim}
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Another way to install \emph{pip} is:

\begin{verbatim}
    sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Install Optional Packages}

VTSG can use combinatorial testing, specifically ACTS~\cite{ACTS2013}, to select
cases instead of producing all possible cases.  The ACTS software is freely available.
To get ACTS, send email to Rick Kuhn
\href{mailto:kuhn@nist.gov}{kuhn@nist.gov}~\cite{CombinTesting}.

See App.~\ref{sec:run csharp} for instructions on how to run \CSharp\ programs.

\subsection{Install VTSG}

\noindent To copy the generic VTSG from GitHub to a local Linux machine, change to a
directory under which you want to install VTSG.

\noindent Looking at the GitHub website, one will see a green box labeled ``Code''.
See Fig.~\ref{fig:clone button}.
Click on it, then click on the ``copy'' icon to copy the web URL.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig_clone_tab.png}
  \caption{usnistgov/VTSG: button to clone repository.}
  \label{fig:clone button}
\end{figure}

\noindent Here is the command to copy the source code and other material to the local
directory:

\begin{verbatim}
    git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/VTSG.git
\end{verbatim}

\noindent If one types the \verb|ls| command, one will see that the \textbf{VTSG}
directory was created.

\noindent Go into that directory, using this command:

\begin{verbatim}
    cd VTSG
\end{verbatim}

\noindent To install the dependencies, use this command:

\begin{verbatim}
    pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Users}

There are two groups who will typically use VTSG. The first group comprises people
requiring test cases written in PHP, \CSharp, or Python to evaluate a static
analyzer. These users must know how to invoke VTSG with the command line interface
and retrieve the appropriate sample from the generated and categorized folders.

The second targeted audience of the VTSG comprises people wishing to generate
test cases using a programming language other than the languages currently
supported.  They must create new templates for the program
using the XML tags, execute VTSG with the command line interface,
and retrieve the samples from the generated and categorized file folders.

\subsection{Vulnerabilities Currently Encoded in VTSG Files}

Vulnerabilities are encoded in the language files, see Sec.~\ref{sec:source files}.
Some of the OWASP Top 10~\cite{OWASPTop10-2017} and
Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs)~\cite{CWE} are encoded.
See App.~\ref{sec:CSharp language}, \ref{sec:PHP language}, and
\ref{sec:Python language} for details.


\section{Command Line Interface}
\label{sec:command line interface}

For users who wish to generate PHP, \CSharp, or Python test suites, a command line
interface
can generate all test cases or a specific group of test cases based on several
options.  For example, the user can generate vulnerable or non-vulnerable test cases
based on selected flaws or groups of flaws, for example, OWASP categories.
The user must specify the
programming language.  The invocation command looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
$ python3 vtsg.py -l {php,cs,py} <options>
\end{verbatim}
% Overleaf complains that textcomp doesn't provide \textlangle
% and \textrangle in the font family.  So we define our own.
\newcommand{\texlangle}{$\langle$}
\newcommand{\texrangle}{$\rangle$}
where \verb|<options>| are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:command line options}.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:command line options}
\end{table} 

\subsection{Explanation of Options}

VTSG will generate all flaws in all flaw groups unless limited with
command line options.
VTSG will generate both the unsafe (buggy or vulnerable)
test cases and the safe (not buggy) test cases if the user does not select
either only safe (-s) or only unsafe (-u) cases.  The options are
mutually exclusive.

The -n (number-generated) option is not very useful.  When the
specified number of sink, filter, input (and exec query, if needed)
combinations are generated, VTSG terminates.  The default, -1,
means generate all combinations.

Each combination of sink, filter, input, and exec query is elaborated
with DEPTH nested complexities.  Suppose there are 5 complexities
and VTSG is invoked with \verb|-r 2|.  Each combination will yield
1 (no complexities) + 5 (each complexity, not nested) + 
25 (each complexities nested within every complexity) = 31 test cases.  
Hence VTSG will generate \emph{far} more test cases than the number
given with the -n option.

\subsection{Example Invocations}

Show the help message:
\begin{verbatim}
$ python3 vtsg.py --help
\end{verbatim}

Generate all PHP test cases:
\begin{verbatim}
$ python3 vtsg.py -l php
\end{verbatim}

This takes about 25 minutes.  (Generating all the \CSharp\ cases takes about four
minutes.)

Generate a \CSharp\ (\verb|-l cs|) test suite made of vulnerable (unsafe) test
cases (\verb|-u|) with SQL injection vulnerabilities (\verb|--flaw=CWE_89|)
and up to 3 nested levels of complexity (\verb|-r 3|).
\begin{verbatim}
$ python3 vtsg.py -l cs -r 3 --flaw=CWE_89 -u
\end{verbatim}
 
\section{Overview of VTSG}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig_VTSG_overview.png}
  \caption{Overview of VTSG test case generation process. The Template
  specifies how pieces are assembled. Input, Filter, Complexity,
  Sink, and ExecQuery modules provide alternative code.  
  An example of
  a generated test case is in 
  Figs.~\ref{fig:example main file} and 
  \ref{fig:example aux file}.}
  \label{fig:VTS operation overview}
\end{figure}

Please note that this document describes two different program structures: the
structure of VTSG itself and the structure of test cases that it generates.

\subsection{Overview of Test Case Generation}

Suppose you write an analyzer to look for bugs in programs.  To test the
analyzer, you need test cases.  Test cases could be lots of many different
programs with lots of different kinds of bugs in different places (and programs
without bugs, too, to test false positives).  It is tedious and error prone to
construct these test cases manually.  VTSG is written to construct huge numbers
of test cases consistently.

In pseudocode, the structure of test cases that VTSG generates is
\begin{verbatim}
        input = get_input_from_somewhere()
        if is an injection attack then
            reject it (filter)
        use the input to make a query (sink)
        execute the query in SQL
\end{verbatim}
You can see this structure in Fig.~\ref{fig:VTS operation overview}.

VTSG generates test cases from information in Template, Input,
Filter, Sink, Complexity and ExecQuery files 
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:VTS operation overview}):
\begin{itemize}
 \item Template is the overall structure of each program.
 \item Input is the source of untrusted data in the program, e.g., 
 command line, variable, files, or form methods.
 \item Filter filters the input with functions or methods such as sanitization
   functions, casting, or deprecated functions.
 \item Sink is where a sensitive operation, such as a database query, 
 is executed with potentially untrusted input and where the 
 vulnerability is triggered.
 \item ExecQuery is an additional piece of code that is mandatory to 
 trigger the vulnerability.
 \item Complexities are additional data flow or control flow complications that are
   worked into the structure of the program to exercise tools' abilities.
\end{itemize}
The content of these files is detailed in
Sec.~\ref{sec:source files}.
Details of the generation process are explained in
Sec.~\ref{sec: generation detail}.

\label{sec:case directory structure}
When invoked to generate test cases, VTSG creates a directory with all the results.
The directory is named for the date and time created, for example,
\verb|TestSuite_03-08-2022_| \verb|16h46m35|.
The language directory, \verb|PHP|,
\verb|Csharp|, or \verb|Python| is created in this directory.
This language name comes from the \verb|name|
in the \verb|file_template.xml| file.  See Sec.~\ref{sec: file template}.

Under the language directory, VTSG creates one directory for each flaw group, for
instance, \verb|OWASP_a1| or \verb|OWASP_a4|.  These come from the \verb|flaw_group|
in the \verb|sinks.xml| file; see Sec.~\ref{sec:sink modules}.
Under each flaw group directory is a subdirectory for each specific flaw, for
instance, \verb|CWE_78| or \verb|CWE_89|.  These come from the \verb|flaw_type|
entries, which are also in the \verb|sinks.xml| file.
VTSG also creates a manifest file of all the test cases generated for each flaw
group, named
\verb|manifest.xml|.

If the \verb|flaw_group| is missing or empty, subdirectories for flaw types are
created immediately under the language directory.

Under the flaw directory are directories for safe or unsafe
(vulnerable) test cases, depending on
which are generated.

\subsection{VTSG Directory Structure}
\label{sec: directory structure}

All the language information files are accessed from a single subdirectory.  The
default is \verb|src/templates|.  Another directory may be given with the -t command
line option, see Table~\ref{tab:command line options}.

Under this is one subdirectory for each language.  VTSG chooses the
subdirectory based on the language given in the \verb|-l| command line
option.  Each language subdirectory has six files for that language.
The files are \verb|file_template.xml|, \verb|inputs.xml|,
\verb|complexities.xml|, \verb|filters.xml|, \verb|sinks.xml|,
and \verb|exec_queries.xml|.
The files are described in Sec.~\ref{sec:source files}.
To add another language,
simply create a subdirectory for that language with the six description
files.

The \verb|src/templates| directory has \verb|file_rights.txt|, which is
copied into each generated test case to declare license rights and
authorship, see Sec.~\ref{sec: file template}, and a 
\verb|dtd| subdirectory, which has document type definitions (DTDs)
for all of the XML files.


\subsection{Details of Test Case Generation}
\label{sec: generation detail}

Each test case is constructed based on the file template, as shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:VTS operation overview}. Test cases are 
programs in a specific programming language.
Each test case is generated by
assembling the modules according to the Template.  The
template may direct construction of a simple test case with just
an Input and a Sink.
The Filter code may be embedded in data and control flow
Complexity code.

VTSG generates test cases with two broad steps.  First, VTSG selects
sink, filter, input, exec query, and complexities that are
compatible with each other and consistent with any flaw group or
flaw constraints the user gives on the command line.  Second, VTSG
composes test case source code from the selected modules, 
synthesizing variable and function names, and writes the file(s).

The code structure is roughly
\begin{verbatim}
    for each specified sink
        for each filter
            for each input
                for each exec query
                    for up to DEPTH combinations of each complexity
                        compose a test case with these modules
\end{verbatim}
The code is more complicated because only compatible modules are 
selected.
In addition, some sinks do not need any input or filtering at all,
see Sec.~\ref{sec:sink modules}.
The
code is structured as a series of function calls to allow types
of modules to be skipped.  Here is a slightly more detailed
overview of those steps, which are in \verb|generator.py|:
\begin{verbatim}
    for each sink:
        if this sink is the type specified:
            use this sink
            if input is needed:
                select_filtering()
            else:
                select_exec_queries()
    
    def select_filtering():
        for each filter:
            if filter is compatible with sink:
                use this filter
                select_input()
    
    def select_input():
        for each input:
            if input is compatible with filter and sink:
                use this input
                select_exec_queries()

    def select_exec_queries():
        if sink needs exec_query:
            for each exec_query:
                if exec_query is compatible with sink:
                    use this exec_query
                    recursion_or_compose()
        else:
            recursion_or_compose()

    def recursion_or_compose():
        if input_type is not none:
            recursive_select_complexity()
        else:
            compose()

    ... and so forth
\end{verbatim}

The \emph{vtsg.py} script creates a new object of the
\emph{Generator} class. 
The program iterates through all sink modules, selecting those
specified by the user, see
Sec.~\ref{sec:command line interface}, 
or all of them if the user does not specify. It subsequently
selects a compatible filter.  It then goes through all inputs.
The \verb|<input_type>| and \verb|<output_type>|
must be consistent with the ``Filter'' and ``Sink'' XML tags.
Then an exec query and complexities are selected
that are compatible with the currently selected sink module.

When VTSG has selected a set of modules, it composes
their code to generate the source code for a test case.
The process of composing modules to generate source code is
based on XML metadata tags.
After the imports and class definition declaration for the 
specific program
language, the ``Input'' metadata \verb|<code>| portion
is added to the test case.  
The ``Filtering'' metadata \verb|<code>| portion, plus its
\verb|<flaw type>| and safety indicator, are added to
the test case.  Next, the ``Sink'' metadata 
\verb|<code>| portion
is added to the test case.  Finally, the ``ExecQuery'' type is 
noted and the 
\verb|<code>| portion of the ``ExecQuery'' is added
to the 
test case.  The test case is written to a file.  
The location chosen for the file is
described in Sec.~\ref{sec:case directory structure}.
Section~\ref{sec:case file name} describes how VTSG names the file.

VTSG generates many different test cases, both with and without
flaws, with various control flow complexities.  After VTSG finishes
generating each vulnerability category, it displays how many safe (non-vulnerable)
and unsafe (vulnerable) test cases it produced.
VTSG generates hundreds of test cases in minutes.

VTSG is built to generate test cases with all consistent combinations
of modules for the flaw groups and flaws specified in the invocation.
If VTSG is invoked with particular flaws (\verb|-f|) or flaw groups (\verb|-g|),
only sinks satisfying those specified are used.
If no flaw group is specified, all flaw groups are used.  
If no flaws are specified, all flaws are used.

\label{sec:depth of complexities}
The depth command line option, \verb|-r| or \verb|--depth|, 
specifies the
most nested flow control complexities produced.
VTSG generates test cases with all complexities up to the depth
indicated.
For example, the default depth, 1, leads VTSG to generate all
test cases with no flow complexities and all test cases with 
one complexity.  The option \verb|-r 2| leads VTSG to generate
all cases with no complexities, all cases with one complexity, 
and all cases with two nested complexities.
See Sec.~\ref{sec:code complexities} for an example of three 
nested control flow complexities.

\subsection{Code Complexities}
\label{sec:code complexities}

In theory, a static analysis tool only needs to process a few lines of
code that
embody the vulnerability. In practice, a tool must analyze much
of the program,
noting its control and data flows, to accurately track data and
determine the
conditions when the code with weaknesses may be executed.
Tracing execution through structures like \verb|while| loops, \verb|if|
statements, and function calls may confuse static analysis tools.
We refer to these constructs as code complexities.
VTSG can nest code complexities to create slightly more realistic source code.

The complexities currently defined
are listed in the appendixes for their languages.

Here is an example of code complexities from \verb|cwe_89__I_shell_commands__F_no_|\\
\verb|filtering__S_select_from-concatenation_simple_quote__EQ_mysql| \\
\verb|__3-2.5-9-21a.cs|: \\
{\texttt
{\colorbox{yellow}{if((Math.Pow(4, 2)<=42))\{}}\\
\hspace*{2em}{\colorbox{green}{switch(6)\{}}\\
\hspace*{4em}{\colorbox{green}{case(6):}}\\
\hspace*{6em}{\colorbox{cyan}{Class\_8 var\_8 = new Class\_8(tainted\_5);}}\\
\hspace*{6em}{\colorbox{cyan}{tainted\_6 = var\_8.get\_var\_8();}}\\
\hspace*{6em}tainted\_7 = tainted\_6;\\
\hspace*{6em}{\colorbox{green}{break;}}\\
\hspace*{4em}{\colorbox{green}{default:}}\\
\hspace*{6em}{\colorbox{green}{break;}}\\              
\hspace*{2em}{\colorbox{green}{\}}}\\
{\colorbox{yellow}{\}else\{}}\\
\hspace*{2em}{\colorbox{yellow}{\{\}}}\\
{\colorbox{yellow}{\}}}
}
\\
The above has three nested control structures:\\
{\colorbox{yellow}{Level 1 is the ``if'' statement.}}\\
\hspace*{2em}{\colorbox{green}{Level 2 is the ``switch'' statement.}}\\
\hspace*{4em}{\colorbox{cyan}{Level 3 is the call of a method from a Class.}}


\section{Template, Input, Filter, Sink, Exec\_Query, and Complexity Files}
\label{sec:source files}

These XML files are required for each language.
There 
are a few XML-specific caveats that must be paid attention to when 
creating these files. 
Table~\ref{tab:XML escapes} lists the symbols that may cause errors 
during the process and the XML equivalent replacement necessary to 
complete the
task without error.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Replacement sequences for characters that are treated 
in a special way in XML files.}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Character} & \textbf{Replacement} \\

 \verb|>| & \&gt; \\

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:XML escapes}
\end{table}

VTSG uses Jinja to compose code. In addition to the above, Jinja recognizes
double-curly-brackets (\{\{ and \}\}) as introducing Jinja-specific variables and
controls.  Do not use pairs of curly brackets in your files, except for VTSG-related
variables.

Characteristics of modules and their information are stored in 
XML files.  
This section of the document describes the structure of each type of module and
the meaning
of each element and its tags.

Most of the file types have an example followed by
an explanation of what it does and what it generates.

Each language directory has one file of each name. That is,
one \verb|file_template.xml| file, one \verb|inputs.xml| file,
one \verb|filters.xml| file, one \verb|complexities.xml| file,
one \\ \verb|sinks.xml| file, and one \verb|exec_queries.xml| file.

All the files, except \verb|file_template.xml|, may have many
modules, that is alternate chucks of code, in them.
For example, \verb|inputs.xml|, Sec.~\ref{sec: input module}, typically has many input
modules.  Each module in \verb|inputs.xml| provides a method to get input from a
different source, such as command line options or hard-coded values.

\subsection{Maintain Indentation with INDENT ... DEDENT}
\label{sec:indent}

VTSG using Jinja does a haphazard job of producing proper indentation.  Indentation
does not matter for many languages.  It is critical for Python, however.  This
section explains how to use INDENT and DEDENT to ensure correct indentation in the
final source code.

\subsubsection{Using INDENT ... DEDENT}
INDENT ... DEDENT sections may appear in any of the above files.  They
most often occur in \verb|file_template.xml| and \verb|complexities.xml| files.

Use INDENT and DEDENT lines in code chunks to indicate that
any code between those lines should be indented consistently.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
def main():
INDENT
    {{local_var}}
    {{input_content}}
    {{filtering_content}}
    {{sink_content}}
    {{exec_queries_content}}
DEDENT
\end{verbatim}
All code produced from the statements between the INDENT/DEDENT lines is
consistently indented with the string defined in \verb|<indent>| \verb|</indent>|,
which appears in \\ \verb|file_template.xml|, see Sec.~\ref{sec: file template}.
That string is typically four spaces.

INDENT sections may be nested.  For example, here is a sink module with code that
needs additional indentation.
\begin{verbatim}
        print(f'file "{ {{in_var_name}} }" ', end='')
        {{flaw}}
        if os.path.exists({{in_var_name}}):
	INDENT
            print('exists')
	DEDENT
        else:
	INDENT
            print('does not exist')
	DEDENT
\end{verbatim}
If the INDENT lines were not included, VTSG produces the following code (slightly
edited for presentation).
\begin{verbatim}
def main():
    tainted_0 = input()
    tainted_1 = tainted_0
    
        # No filter (sanitization)
        tainted_1 = tainted_0
            
    
        print(f'file "{ tainted_1 }" ', end='')
        #flaw
        if os.path.exists(tainted_1):
            print('exists')
	else:
            print('does not exist')
\end{verbatim}
Notice that the indentation is not consistent. This is not valid Python code.
With INDENT lines, VTSG produces the following, which is valid Python.
\begin{verbatim}
def main():
    tainted_0 = input()
    tainted_1 = tainted_0

    # No filter (sanitization)
    tainted_1 = tainted_0


    print(f'file "{ tainted_1 }" ', end='')
    #flaw
    if os.path.exists(tainted_1):
        print('exists')
    else:
        print('does not exist')
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Details of INDENT ... DEDENT}

Here are details of using INDENT and DEDENT.

VTSG processes code within INDENT sections line by line. No semantic parsing or
analysis is done.

A section to be fixed is indicated by a line beginning with \verb|INDENT|, possibly
with leading whitespace. The end of the section is indicated by a line beginning with
\verb|DEDENT|, again possibly with leading whitespace. Any text after INDENT or
DEDENT to the end of the line is ignored.

Indent sections may be nested.

INDENT and DEDENT lines are removed.
For lines within an INDENT ... DEDENT section,
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item first, any leading whitespace is removed, and
\item second, if the line is not empty, indentation is added for each nested
  INDENT ... DEDENT section this is in.
\end{itemize}

Here is a convoluted example to illustrate the fine points.  Suppose this is the
code generated by composing the modules.
\begin{verbatim}
      if Condition:
INDENT            text after INDENT is ignored
           line 1
               while not True:
          INDENT
           line 3 - INDENT not at the beginning is ignored
     DEDENT

                  line above is empty
        DEDENT
        line 5
\end{verbatim}
If the indent string is specified as \verb|<indent>..,</indent>|, the following is
the result. (Note: typically, the indent is four spaces. The preceding string with
periods and a comma is only for example clarity.)
\begin{verbatim}
      if Condition:
..,line 1
..,while not True:
..,..,line 3 - INDENT not at the beginning is ignored

..,line above is empty
        line 5
\end{verbatim}

Note: because \emph{all} leading whitespace is removed from lines in indent sections,
using INDENT ... DEDENT anywhere means that every indentation must be indicated
with INDENT ... DEDENT lines.

We chose ``DEDENT'' because it is used in Python's grammar description.


\subsection{File Template}
\label{sec: file template}

\begin{verbatim}
<template type="" name="">
    <file_extension></file_extension>
    <comment>
        <open></open>
        <close></close>
        <inline></inline>
    </comment>
    <syntax>
        <statement_terminator></statement_terminator>
        <indent></indent>
    </syntax>
    <namespace></namespace>
    <variables prefix="" import_code="using {{import_file}};">
        <variable type="" code="" init=""/>
    </variables>
    <imports>
        <import></import>
    </imports>
    <code></code>
</template>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
    \item name: Programming language name, e.g., PHP, Csharp,
    or Python. This appears in the manifest.
    It is also the name of the subdirectory under the TestSuite directory
    where all the generated test cases are placed.

    \item file\_extension: Extension of the generated files.

    \item comment: Strings indicating comments.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item open: string to begin a comment, which may span many lines
        \item close: string to end a comment, which may span many lines
        \item inline: string to begin a one-line comment
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item syntax: Other language-specific syntax.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item statement\_terminator: string to show the end of 
        a statement.
        This is semicolon
        \verb|<statement_terminator>;</statement_terminator>|
        in PHP, C, Java, \\ and \CSharp. Python does not have 
        a terminator, so this is the empty string: \\
        \verb|<statement_terminator></statement_terminator>|.

        \item indent: string used to indent code, see Sec.~\ref{sec:indent}.
          This is typically four spaces, but
          can be any string.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item namespace: Namespace name, if applicable

    \item variables: Information about variable names and types and how
    to include libraries.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item prefix: Any prefix required for variable names.
        \$ for PHP.
        Leave it empty if not required.

        \item import\_code: Code to include a library. The code
        should have the placeholder \verb|{{import_file}}|.
        For example, \verb|#include <{{import_name}}>|.
        
        \item variable: Defines each variable type and how to initialize it. (optional)
        \begin{itemize}
        \item type: Names the type. This string 
        does not appear in the test case code.  It tells VTSG
        the type of variable that is being used.  The input\_type
        and output\_type in Input, Filter, and Sink modules use
        this string.

        \item code: A piece of code to declare the type of the variable. For
        some languages, such as PHP and Python, this field can be blank. 
        This value gives the variable type when being declared, for example,
        \verb|string var_0;|.  In this case, ``string''
        is the value put in this attribute.

        \item init: Value assigned when this type of variable is initialized.
        \end{itemize}
        If variables do not need to be declared in this language, do not include
        any \verb|<variable ... />| statements or the \verb|{{local_var}}|
        placeholder in the code.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item code: the template code. It should contain the 
    following placeholders:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item comments: This is replaced by comments in the selected input,
        filter, sink, and exec query modules.  This is intended to
        describe the variants, options, and use of this test case. 
        
        \item license: This is replaced by the contents of the
        \verb|file_rights.txt| file.  This is intended to hold
        authors' names, usage and copyrights, contact information, 
        etc.
        
        \item stdlib\_imports:  This is a placeholder for
        \emph{all} imports for the generated program

        \item namespace\_name:  Used if the language requires it

        \item main\_name:  Name of the main class

        \item local\_var: Location to declare local variables (optional).  If
          variables do not need to be declared in this language, do not include this
          placeholder or any \verb|<variable ... />| statements in the variables.

        \item input\_content:  Location for the Input (required)

        \item filtering\_content: Location of the Filter, which will be wrapped with
          complexities, if any.

        \item sink\_content:  Location for the Sink

        \item exec\_queries\_content:  Location for the ExecQuery

        \item static\_methods:  Location for the static functions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Attributes Shared By Modules}
\label{sec:shared attributes}

Many kinds of modules use the same attributes.  Instead of repeating explanation of
these attributes, they are here.

\subsubsection{Module Description in Path and Dir Tags}
\label{sec:module description}

Within the \verb|<path>| keywords, modules may have one or more \verb|<dir>| tags.
These tags provide the descriptions of the module that is used in the file name, see
Sec.~\ref{sec:case file name}.  For example, when the key word in a selected input
module is ``file'', the file name will contain \verb|..._I_file_...|, where ``I''
indicates the input module selected.

If a module has more than one \verb|<dir>| tag, the strings are joined with dashes.
For example, if a sink has
\begin{verbatim}
            <path>
                <dir>select_from</dir>
                <dir>concatenation_simple_quote</dir>
            </path>
\end{verbatim}
then cases using that module will have file names containing \\
\verb|_S_select_from-concatenation_simple_quote_|.

Note: we cannot think of any reason why it is better to give multiple description
strings instead of just one string.  But the functionality is provided in VTSG, and
some modules use it.


\subsubsection{Module Comment}
\label{sec:module comment}

If a sample module has a comment string, it is added to the
\verb|{{comments}}| area given in the file template, Sec.~\ref{sec: file template}.
This informs the user about the purpose or structure of the input, filter, sink, and
exec query modules included.  Below is an example comment string.

\begin{verbatim}
            <comment>sink: check if a file exists</comment>
\end{verbatim}

Any case using that module will have
\begin{verbatim}
sink: check if a file exists
\end{verbatim}
in the comments area.


\subsubsection{Needed Imports}
\label{sec:module import}

Sometimes the use of code requires some library to be imported or used.  This is
indicated with names given in \verb|<import></import>| directives within
\verb|<imports></imports>| sections.

Code statements are synthesized from the \verb|import_code| in the file template and
the name or names given here.


\subsubsection{Marking Modules as Safe and Unsafe}
\label{sec:safe or unsafe}

Using some modules in a program for certain flaws may make them safe or may make them
unsafe.  For instance, prepared SQL statements are always safe from SQL injection
vulnerabilities.  In contrast using a broken cryptographic algorithm is always
unsafe, regardless of how any user input is filtered.  Similarly certain
hard-coded inputs may always make a program safe from certain flaws, and some filters
may make a program safe from certain flaws for any user input.

Input, filter, and sink modules can be marked as always safe or always unsafe using
\verb|safe="1"| or \verb|unsafe="1"|.  Modules may be always safe or always unsafe
(or neither) for some flaws and have different safety attributes for other
flaws.

Exec query modules may be marked as always safe.  (No exec query module can make the
program unsafe.)

A generated program is not safe if any of the selected input, filter, or sink modules
are always unsafe, that is \verb|unsafe="1"|.  A program is safe if any of the
selected input, filter, sink, or exec query modules is always safe, that is
\verb|safe="1"|, \emph{and} none
are unsafe.  If no module is safe, the generated program is unsafe.
The filter module must be executed to be considered.  In other words, if
a complexity never executes the filter, then the filter's safe or unsafe marking is
ignored.  Table~\ref{tab:selection safe algorithm} expresses this as a table.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Decision table for whether a set of modules is safe or unsafe.}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|}
  & \makecell{Any module \\ has safe="1"}
  & \makecell{No module is \\ always safe} \\
\hline
\makecell{Any module \\ has unsafe="1"}  & not safe & not safe \\
\hline
\makecell{No module is \\ always unsafe} &   safe   & not safe \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:selection safe algorithm}
\end{table}

The Code Complexity Modules, Sec.~\ref{sec: complexity modules}, explains when a
filter may never be executed.


\subsection{Input Modules}
\label{sec: input module}

The \verb|inputs.xml| file has one or more ``sample'' input modules.  Each module
provides one way for the generated program to get input.

\begin{verbatim}
<sample>
    <path>
        <dir></dir>
    </path>
    <comment></comment>
    <flaws>
        <flaw flaw_type="" [safe=""] [unsafe=""]/>
    </flaws>
    <imports>
        <import></import>
    </imports>
    <code></code>
    <input_type></input_type>
    <output_type></output_type>
</sample>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \includegraphics{fig_Input_file.png}
  \caption{Example Input module.  Instantiated at line 14 of 
  Fig.~\ref{fig:example main file}.}
  \label{fig:example input file}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item dir and path, comment, and imports: see Sec.~\ref{sec:shared attributes}.

    \item flaw: indicate whether this input is always safe, always unsafe, or
      neither for a particular flaw type.  See Sec.~\ref{sec:safe or unsafe} for
      more details.  If this input has the same safe/unsafe value for most
      types of vulnerabilities, put ``default'' as the \verb|flaw_type|.

    \item input\_type: this string is placed in the manifest.  It has no other
      function in VTSG.

    \item output\_type: the type of output.  The variable generated with the
      placeholder \\ \verb|{{out_var_name}}| in the code will be that type.
      An input module is selected if it matches the \verb|input_type| of the Filter
      (or of the Sink, if the Filter \verb|input_type| is ``nofilter'').

    \item code: The source code of an input. It should contain the placeholder \\
      \verb|{{out_var_name}}|.  That placeholder will be replaced by the variable
      name used in the Filter and Sink.  Do not declare this variable.
\end{itemize}

The case generated from the example Input in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:example input file}
takes an argument from the command line as Input.  
The input string can be either safe or unsafe, depending on user input.

\subsection{Filter Modules}

All filter modules are in the \verb|filters.xml| file.

\begin{verbatim}
<sample>
    <path>
        <dir></dir>
    </path>
    <comment></comment>
    <flaws>
        <flaw flaw_type="" [safe=""] [unsafe=""]/>
    </flaws>
    <imports></imports>
    <code></code>
    <input_type></input_type>
    <output_type></output_type>
    <options need_complexity=""/>
</sample>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig_Filter_file.png}
  \caption{Example Filter module. Instantiated in lines 19--27 of
           Fig.~\ref{fig:example aux file}.}
  \label{fig:example filter file}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item dir and path, comment, and imports: see Sec.~\ref{sec:shared attributes}.

    \item input\_type: the input type of the filter. The variable 
    generated with
    the placeholder \verb|{{in_var_name}}| will be that type.
    Declarations of \verb|variable| in the File Template give
    available types, see Sec.~\ref{sec: file template}.

    \item output\_type: the output type of the filter.  The variable generated
    with the placeholder \verb|{{out_var_name}}| will be that type.

    \item flaw: indicate whether this filter is always safe, always unsafe, or
      neither for a particular flaw type.  See Sec.~\ref{sec:safe or unsafe} for
      more details.  If this filter has the same safe/unsafe value for most
      types, put ``default'' as the \verb|flaw_type|.

    \item code: The source code of an filter. It should contain the placeholders
    \\
    \verb|{{in_var_name}}| and \verb|{{out_var_name}}|.  Those placeholders will 
    be replaced by the variable names that will be used in the Input and in Sink.  Do
    not declare these variables.
    \verb|{{out_var_name}}| must receive a value in all possible executions of the
    filter.
    \\
    Tip: To generate a test without functional filtering, just assign
    \verb|out_var_name| the value of \verb|in_var_name|, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
    {{out_var_name}} = {{in_var_name}};
\end{verbatim}
    and make the input\_type and output\_type \verb|nofilter|.
    This passes the value from the Input directly to the Sink.

    \item options: By default filters are wrapped in complexities.  Complexities may
      be disabled by adding \verb|options| with \verb|need_complexity="0"|.
      In other words, if \linebreak[4] \verb|need_complexity| is in
      \verb|<options />| with anything other than ``1'', VTSG does not generate any
      variations with complexities.
\end{itemize}

The example Filter file in Fig.~\ref{fig:example filter file} makes sure
the Input contains only a number.  
The flag safe is 1, because you cannot cause an SQL Injection 
(CWE 89) with only numbers.


\subsection{Sink Modules}
\label{sec:sink modules}

All sink modules are in the language's \verb|sinks.xml| file.

\begin{verbatim}
<sample>
    <path>
        <dir></dir>
    </path>
    <flaw_type flaw_group=""></flaw_type>
    <safety safe="" unsafe=""/>
    <comment></comment>
    <imports>
        <import></import>
    </imports>
    <code></code>
    <input_type></input_type>
    <exec_type></exec_type>
</sample>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
    \item dir and path, comment, and imports: see Sec.~\ref{sec:shared attributes}.

    \item flaw\_type: the flaw\_group is a general category of vulnerability.
    Generated test cases are placed under the flaw group subdirectory, then
    in the flaw type subdirectory under that.  If the flaw\_group is missing or
    empty, flaw type subdirectories are created immediately under the language
    directory.
    The user can limit
    cases generated to certain flaw groups with \verb|-g| command
    line options or certain flaws with \verb|-f| options.
    
    \item input\_type: the input type of the sink. The variable
    generated with the placeholder \verb|{{in_var_name}}| will be 
    that type.  If the sink does not
    require an input, this type should be \verb|none|. The code 
    should not contain
    the placeholder \verb|{{in_var_name}}|.
    Declarations of \verb|variable| in the File Template give
    available types, see Sec.~\ref{sec: file template}.

    The input type specifies the kind of data this sink needs from the filter (or
    from the input).  VTSG only selects filters whose output types are the same as
    this input type.  If the filter input type is ``nofilter'',
    then VTSG selects input modules whose
    output types are the same as this input type.

    \item exec\_type: link a sink to the exec queries.  It must have 
    the type of
    an ExecQuery. If it does not require an ExecQuery, 
    exec\_type should be \verb|none|.

    \item safety: whether the sink is always safe or always unsafe.  For instance, a
      deprecated function may be marked (always) unsafe.
      See Sec.~\ref{sec:safe or unsafe}
      for more details.
    
    \item code: The source code of a sink. It should contain the placeholder
    \verb|{{in_var_name}}|.  The placeholder will be replaced by the variable
    name used in the Filter.  Do not declare this variable.

    The placeholder \verb|{{flaw}}| indicates that the next line is the location
    of the flaw.  In other words, if this case is unsafe, the manifest reports a
    flaw at the line following this.  In generated unsafe cases,
    \verb|{{flaw}}| is replaced with the one-line comment string,
    see Sec.~\ref{sec: file template}, and ``flaw''.
    It does not appear in generated safe cases.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig_Sink_file.png}
  \caption{Example Sink module. Instantiated at line 23 of
           Fig.~\ref{fig:example main file}.}
  \label{fig:example sink file}
\end{figure}

The Sink example in Fig.~\ref{fig:example sink file} 
concatenates the filtered string with an SQL query.  This block
of code can only be used for SQL Injection.  Whether or not it is
vulnerable depends on the input string.


\subsection{Exec\_Query Modules}

All query execution modules are in the language's \verb|exec_query.xml|
file.

\begin{verbatim}
<exec_query type="" safe="">
    <path>
        <dir></dir>
    </path>
    <comment></comment>
    <imports>
        <import></import>
    </imports>
    <code></code>
</exec_query>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
    \item type: the type of the ExecQuery. This is used in the
    \verb|exec_type| tag of the Sink to link them together during
    generation process.  The type should only contain letters, numerals, and
    underscore (``\_'').\\
    Languages currently available for VTSG support many database management
    systems, including ORACLE, MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and XPATH.
    The syntax of each ExecQuery must be
    compatible with its associated database system language.
    
    \item safe: whether the ExecQuery always makes the case safe.
    See Sec.~\ref{sec:safe or unsafe} for more details.

    \item dir and path, comment, and imports: see Sec.~\ref{sec:shared attributes}.

    \item code: The source code of a query. It does not contain placeholders.
    It should be linked to the corresponding variable from the Sink. The linking is done through the "exec\_type" attributes within the XML files.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig_Exec_Query_file.png}
  \caption{Example Exec\_Query module. Instantiated in lines 25--39 of
    Fig.~\ref{fig:example main file}.}
  \label{fig:example exec-query file}
\end{figure}

The block of code in the Exec\_Query example, 
Fig.~\ref{fig:example exec-query file}, executes the SQL query, used 
for database management
systems, including MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.  This example is
vulnerable.  If a non-vulnerable execution of an SQL query is required,
use an SQL prepared statement.


\subsection{Test Condition and Code Complexity Modules}

All test condition and code complexity modules are in the 
language's \verb|complexities.xml| file.  This file has
a \verb|<root>| with one \verb|<conditions>| part and one
\verb|<complexities>| part.
All condition modules are inside \verb|<conditions>|.  All
complexity modules are inside \verb|<complexities>|.

\begin{verbatim}
<root>
    <conditions>
        <condition ...>
            ...
        </condition>
        ....
    </conditions>
    <complexities>
        <complexity ...>
            ...
        </complexity>
        ....
    <complexities>
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Test Condition Modules}
\label{sec: condition modules}

\begin{verbatim}
<condition id="">
    <code></code>
    <value></value>
</condition>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
    \item id: string indicating this condition.  Appears in the test case
      file name.  Typically this is a number.

    \item code: the source code of the conditional test.

    \item value: either \verb|<value>True</value>| or
        \verb|<value>False</value>| depending on \\
        whether the code always evaluates to true or false.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Code Complexity Modules}
\label{sec: complexity modules}

\begin{verbatim}
<complexity id="" type="" group="" executed="" in_out_var="i" 
                       need_condition="" indirection="" need_id="">
    <code></code>
    <body></body>
</complexity>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
    \item id: string indicating this complexity.  Appears in the test case
      file name.  Typically this is a number.

    \item type: Used types are: \verb|if|, \verb|switch|, \verb|goto|,
    \verb|for|, \verb|foreach|, \verb|while|,
    \verb|function|, and \verb|class|.
    If the type is \verb|class|, source code in the \verb|<body></body>| is placed in
    an additional file that is created for this case.
    Invocation statements are generated for \verb|function| and \verb|class| types.

    An extra variable is created for \verb|foreach| type complexities (with group
    \verb|loops|).
    No other type has any effect on VTSG.

    \item group: Used groups are: \verb|conditionals|, \verb|jumps|,
    \verb|loops|, \verb|functions|, and \verb|classes|.
    No group, other than \verb|loops|, has any effect on VTSG.

    \item executed: whether the placeholder will be executed or not. Four 
    values are allowed:
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item 0: Never executed
        \item 1: Always executed
        \item condition:  Executed if the condition is true
        \item not\_condition:  Executed if the condition is false
    \end{itemize}
    Table~\ref{tab:execution examples} gives example code for each value.

    \item in\_out\_var: whether the variable (from the Input) will be used or
    transformed in the Complexity before being used in the Filter.  If the
    variable is neither used nor transformed, do not use this attribute.
    Three values are allowed:
    \begin{itemize}[nosep]
        \item in: the variable is used before the placeholder
        \item out: the variable is used after the placeholder
        \item traversal: the variable is used in the placeholder
    \end{itemize}
    If this attribute is used, the code should contain the following
    placeholders: \\
    \verb|{{in_var_name}}|, \verb|{{out_var_name}}|, and \verb|{{var_type}}|.

    \item need\_condition: ``1'' if this complexity needs a condition.
      This complexity is also combined with conditions (see
      Sec.~\ref{sec: condition modules}) if \verb|executed| is \verb|condition|
      or \\ \verb|not_condition|. (optional)

    \item indirection: ``1'' if the code is split into two chunks (call and
    declaration) or calls a function.  The body tag should be present when
    calling a function.

    \item code: the source code of the Complexity.  Code or

    \verb|{{condition}}| where the Condition
    is inserted.

  \label{fig:example complexity-method file}
\end{figure}

VTSG can put several complexities in one test case.
The example in Sec.~\ref{sec:case file name} has two types of
Complexity: a control flow complexity and a data flow complexity. 
The control flow complexity specification is in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:example complexity-while file}.  It is instantiated in 
lines 16--21 of
Fig.~\ref{fig:example main file}.  Line 16 is the instantiation of 
the control flow condition
specified in Fig.~\ref{fig:example complexity-test file}.

The data flow complexity is a method call within the \verb|while| loop.  
The specification
is in Fig.~\ref{fig:example complexity-method file}.  
The \verb|<code>|
part is instantiated in lines 18 and 19 of 
Fig.~\ref{fig:example main file}. 
The \verb|<body>| part is instantiated in

\section{Adding to VTSG}

The next subsection is a brief tutorial giving advice on how to add a new flaw to an
existing language in VTSG.  The subsection after that gives some advice on how to add
a new language.  Finally a subsection offers some guidance on adding new capabilities
or features.

\subsection{How to Add a Flaw}

The easiest way to add a new flaw is modify a similar existing flaw to present the
new flaw.  If nothing is suitable, here is a tutorial for writing a brand new flaw.

There are so many interacting specifications for a flaw, it is best to write it in
three steps: first, write the flaw in regular source code; second, decide how to
divide the code among modules, and third, specify the pieces in VTSG.

As a first step, choose a generated test case and modify the source code to present
the target flaw.  Here is the core code of
a potential divide by zero guarded by a filter:
\begin{verbatim}
    data = console_input()

    if data == 0:
        print('Invalid input')
        sys.exit(1)

    print(f'The reciprocal of {data} is {1/data}')
\end{verbatim}
You may want to try different variants to find which fits your needs best.  For
instance, one variant of this flaw is for the filter to provide a safe value instead
of aborting, like this:
(Since the the console input line is always the same, we will not show it
further.)
\begin{verbatim}
    if data == 0:
        print('Invalid input')
        data = 1

    print(f'The reciprocal of {data} is {1/data}')
\end{verbatim}
Another variant is for the weakness itself to be guarded by the filter:
\begin{verbatim}
    if data != 0:
        print(f'The reciprocal of {data} is {1/data}')
    else:
        print('Invalid input')
\end{verbatim}

It helps later checking to write the code to demonstrate the failure, instead of
failing silently.  In the above code if division by zero is ever attempting, Python
aborts with failure messages.  In contrast consider a path traversal weakness.  Path
traversal is when the user might access private directories.  Here is a simple
version.  It intends to open a file named by the user in the \verb|/home| directory:
\begin{verbatim}
    tainted_1 = input() # read one line

    file = os.path.join('/home', tainted_1)
    f = open(file, 'r')
\end{verbatim}
Running this with an input that exploits the weakness, like
\verb|../etc/passwd|, doesn't give any indication that the exploit succeeded.  The
file is opened and then the program ends.  The following variant is better.  It
prints a line from the password file to demonstrate the exploit:
\begin{verbatim}
    tainted_1 = input() # read one line

    file = os.path.join('/home', tainted_1)
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        print(f.readline(), end='')
\end{verbatim}


The second step is to decide what parts of the code are inputs, what parts are
filters (which will be wrapped in complexities), and what parts are sinks.

If you want to generate cases where some piece of code may or may not be executed,
put that code in Filter modules.  The second example above might generate a case
like this.  (Comments show the origin of each piece of source code.)
\begin{verbatim}
    # Complexity
    if True:
        # Filter
        if data == 0:
            print('Invalid input')
            data = 1

    # Sink
    print(f'The reciprocal of {data} is {1/data}')
\end{verbatim}

If the sink is guarded, as in the third example, it may need to be a Filter module.
In this case, the ``Sink'' module may be empty.
\begin{verbatim}
    # Complexity
    if True:
        # Filter
        if data != 0:
            print(f'The reciprocal of {data} is {1/data}')
        else:
            print('Invalid input')
\end{verbatim}


Now that you have an idea of how to split up the code, the third step is to
write a new sink (or filter) module in VTSG for the flaw.  Edit the sinks.xml (or
filters.xml) file to add it, then run VTSG.  It's likely that nothing is
generated the very first time you try because VTSG cannot find a compatible input and
filter.

\label{sec:connecting inputs, filters, and sinks}
Figure~\ref{fig:VTS operation overview} suggests that the result of the Input module
connects to and must match the input of the Filter module, and its output connects to
and must match the input of the Sink.  These modules are shown together in
Fig.~\ref{fig:input, filter, and sink}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig_input_filter_sink.png}}
  \caption{The result of the Input module connects to the input of the Filter module,
    its output connects to the input of the Sink module, and its output connects
    to the input of the Exec Query module.
  }
  \label{fig:input, filter, and sink}
\end{figure}
Compatible inputs, filters, sinks, and exec queries are ``connected'' various
ways.  Remember that
VTSG first chooses a sink module then chooses compatible filter, input, and exec
query modules to
use with it.  A filter is used with a sink if
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item the filter \verb|output_type| is ``nofilter'' or the same as the sink
  \verb|input_type| \emph{and}
\item the filter has a \verb|flaw_type| that is ``default'' or is the same as the
  sink \verb|flaw_type|.
\end{enumerate}
Figure~\ref{fig:how filters fit a sink} suggests that filters A, B, and C will
be used with the sink.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{fig_filters_and_sinks.png}}
  \caption{How filters are chosen for a sink.  Filters A, B, and C will be used.
    Filter P is not used because the flaw\_type differs.
    Filter Q is not used because the output\_type differs.
  }
  \label{fig:how filters fit a sink}
\end{figure}
Filter B is compatible because the \verb|flaw_type| is
``default''; it is compatible with any type of flaw.  Filter C is ``nofilter'' and
just passes the value through.  Filter P is never used with that sink because
the \verb|flaw_type| is not the same.
Filter Q is never used because the \verb|output_type| is not the same as the
sink \verb|input_type|.

An input is used with a sink and a filter if
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item the filter \verb|input_type| is ``nofilter'' and the \verb|output_type|
  of the input is the same as the sink \verb|input_type| \emph{or}
\item the filter \verb|input_type| is something other than ``nofilter'' and the
  \verb|output_type| of the input is the same as the filter \verb|input_type|.
\end{enumerate}
Fig.~\ref{fig:how inputs fit} illustrates this matching rule.  Input 1 is used with
Filter A, and Input 2 is used with Filter B.  Input 1 is also used with Filter C
because Filter C is ``nofilter'' and Input 1 matches the sink.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=.667\linewidth]{fig_inputs_filters_and_sinks.png}}
  \caption{How inputs are chosen for a filter and sink.  Input 1 is used with
    Filter A.  Input 2 is used with Filter B.  Input 1 is also used with Filter C
    because Filter C is ``nofilter'' and Input 1 matches the sink.
  }
  \label{fig:how inputs fit}
\end{figure}

Be aware that any string is allowed in the \verb|input_type| or \verb|output_type|.
This allows you to use a kind of ``extended types'' to connect specific inputs,
filters, and sinks.  An example is in Python.  I wanted the input to be wrapped in
complexities, like the following:
\begin{verbatim}
    # Input
    tainted_1 = None

    # Complexity
    if 5 == 5:
        # Filter
        tainted_1 = input()

    # Sink
    if tainted_1 is not None:
        # flaw # no validation - allows arbitrary execution
        sys.path += [tainted_1]
        print(f'added { tainted_1 } to Python module search path')
\end{verbatim}
Variables aren't declared in Python, but I had to initialize the variable to
\verb|None| in case the input is not executed.  I declared the variable in the input
module and put the input code in the filter module, so that the input code would be
wrapped in complexities.  I used custom types \verb|string,filter_input| to connect
the sink to the ``filter'' (really, input) and \verb|InitToNone| to connect the
``filter'' to the ``input'' (really, initialization).

Figuring out how to mark the modules as safe or unsafe can be tricky.
The following code may allow a large \emph{negative} index access, and thus cause an
exception.  I thought this is always unsafe.
\begin{verbatim}
    if index < len(array):
        print(array[index])
\end{verbatim}
I discovered my mistake when I executed the cases and ``unsafe'' cases did
\emph{not} produce the exploit evidence.  If the ``input'' was a safe hardcoded
value, the code was safe!
\begin{verbatim}
    index = 0

    if index < len(array):
        print(array[index])
\end{verbatim}
The proper marking is that the sink is neither always safe nor always unsafe.
A proper filter or guard can make it safe.
See Sec.~\ref{sec:safe or unsafe} for details.


\subsection{How to Add a Language}

The easiest way is to
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item decide the short name of the language, e.g., py for Python or php for
  PHP.  Using the extension of those programs is a good idea.
\item create a directory by that name under src/template
\item copy the six files of an existing language
\item change the name attribute in file\_template.xml to the language name.
\end{enumerate}
Change language characteristics in all the files.  Generate a few cases and
execute them to make sure syntax and other details are correct.  It's best to
start by converting just one or two sinks, inputs, and filters for quick turn around.
Comment out all the rest of the modules to start.
As you convert or add flaws, you may find that some language specifications need
adjustment.


\subsection{Adding New Capabilities to VTSG}

New VTSG capabilities often allow the user who is describing programming languages or
flaws to make new mistakes.  Suppose input modules now have a \verb|parallel|
attribute, which must have one or more types of processing, such as Single
Instruction, Single Data (SISD); Multiple Instruction, Single Data (MISD); Single
Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD); Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD); Single
Program, Multiple Data (SPMD), or Massively Parallel Processing (MPP).  What should
VTSG do when the user gives an input module a \verb|parallel| attribute, but no type
of processing?  VTSG code could just crash with a traceback about \verb|NoneType|
object.  This does not help the user much.

If the user can make a mistake, such as mismatched attributes or invalid fields, VTSG
should explain what the problem is, where it arose, why it is invalid (e.g. where the
information will be used), and what are correct approaches or alternatives.  For
example, for an empty \verb|<dir></dir>| in an input module, VTSG reports
\begin{verbatim}
[ERROR] Invalid empty <dir></dir> in the inputs file.
A dir string is required; it is used in the name of the generated file.
\end{verbatim}
then exits.

In case of an error due to a bug in VTSG itself, it may crash.  In theory, VTSG
developers will find and fix all bugs before the user runs it.


\section{Generated Test Case File Names}

This section describes how the names of test case files are created.

VTSG creates directories and subdirectories for the test cases that it generates.
The directory structure is described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:case directory structure}.

%\subsection{Test Case File Names}
\label{sec:case file name}

VTSG names test case files as
\verb|FLAW__I_INPUT__F_FILTER__S_SINK__EQ_EXEC_| \\
\verb|QUERY__NMBCPLX-CMPLX1[.COND]-CMPLX2[.COND]x.EXT|
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item FLAW: Flaw type, e.g. CWE\_89, BF, or STR30-PL, see
	Sec.~\ref{sec:sink modules}.
    \item INPUT: Input description (dirs), see Sec.~\ref{sec:module description} (optional)
    \item FILTER:  Filter description (dirs) (optional)
    \item SINK:  Description (dirs) of the critical function
    \item EXEC\_QUERY:  ExecQuery description (dirs) (optional)

    \item NMBCPLX:  The number of complexities.
    \item CMPLX1[.COND], CMPLX2[.COND], \ldots: List of complexities.
            CMPLX is the id in the code complexity module,
            see Sec.~\ref{sec: complexity modules}.
            If the complexity has a
            condition, COND is the id in the test condition module,
            see Sec.~\ref{sec: condition modules}.
            Tables \ref{tab:complexity IDs for CSharp},
            \ref{tab:complexity IDs for PHP}, and
            \ref{tab:complexity IDs for Python} in the language appendixes list
            complexity ids defined in \CSharp, PHP, and Python.
            Tables \ref{tab:condition IDs for CSharp},
            \ref{tab:condition IDs for PHP}, and
            \ref{tab:condition IDs for Python} list condition
            ids defined in \CSharp, PHP, and Python. (optional)
    \item x: Sequence of the file within the test.  If the test consists of just one
      file, there is no sequence letter.  If the test consists of more than one file,
      that is, when the complexity \verb|type| is \verb|class|,
      see Sec.~\ref{sec: complexity modules},
      the main file is ``a'', and other files, such as classes, are ``b'', ``c'',
      ``d'', etc. (optional)
    \item EXT: file extension, given in the \verb|file_template.xml| file, see
    Sec.~\ref{sec: file template}.
\end{itemize}

File names reflect the entire case, not just the code in a
particular file.  If a case consists of more than one file, as in the
example used in this manual, all files have
identical names, except for the final sequence letter.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig_example_code1.png}
  \caption{Main file of example. Line 14 instantiates input code from 
    Fig.~\ref{fig:example input file}. Lines 16--19 instantiates complexity code from 
    Fig.~\ref{fig:example complexity-while file}. Line 16 instantiates condition code from
    Fig.~\ref{fig:example complexity-test file}.  Lines 18 and 19 instantiate code from the
    \texlangle code\texrangle\  part of Fig.~\ref{fig:example complexity-method file}.
    Line 23 instantiates critical preparation code from Fig.~\ref{fig:example sink file}.
    Lines 25--39 instantiate query execution code from Fig.~\ref{fig:example exec-query file}.
  }
  \label{fig:example main file}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{fig_example_code2.png}
  \caption{Auxiliary file of example.  It instantiates code from the
    \texlangle body\texrangle\ part of Fig.~\ref{fig:example complexity-method file}.
    Lines 19--27 instantiate filter code
    from Fig.~\ref{fig:example filter file}.}
  \label{fig:example aux file}
\end{figure}

As an example of a file name, consider the test case used in this manual.  The case
consists of
two files.
Fig.~\ref{fig:example main file} is the main file of the example.  
Fig.~\ref{fig:example aux file} is an auxiliary class file.  
The code in
the main file invokes the class at line 18.

The name of the main file is
\verb|CWE_89__I_shell_commands__F_func_preg_match-| \\
\verb|only_numbers__S_select_from-concatenation_simple_quote__sql_server| \\
\verb|__2-11.7-20a.cs|.
The name of the class file, Fig.~\ref{fig:example aux file}, is
identical, except for the
file letter ``b'' instead of ``a'' at the end.

The extension, cs, shows that it is a \CSharp\ file.
We understand the file name as follows:

\noindent CWE 89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command
('SQL Injection') \cite{CWE89}

\noindent The input comes from shell\_commands, see specification in
Fig.~\ref{fig:example input file}.

\noindent The filter is func\_preg\_match-only\_numbers,
Fig.~\ref{fig:example filter file}.

\noindent The sink is select\_from-concatenation\_simple\_quote\_\_sql\_server,
Fig.~\ref{fig:example sink file}.

\noindent The last part, 2-11.7-20, describes the complexities.
The first number, 2, means this has two complexities.
Tables~\ref{tab:complexity IDs for CSharp} and
\ref{tab:condition IDs for CSharp} help us decode them.
The first, outer complexity is 11 with condition 7. 11 is \verb|while|,
Fig.~\ref{fig:example complexity-while file}, 
with condition 7 meaning \verb|Math.Sqrt(42)<=42|, which always evaluates to true,
Fig.~\ref{fig:example complexity-test file}.
The second, inner complexity is 20 meaning the sink code is executed in the class body,
Fig.~\ref{fig:example complexity-method file}.

\noindent ``a'' means this is the main file.

\label{sec:run csharp}
To compile and run \CSharp\ test cases, install \emph{mono} and \emph{mcs}.
The Mono project created \emph{mono} as an open source platform that
implements the .NET Framework. Class libraries and \CSharp\ compilation are enabled
by \emph{mcs}. See \href{http://github.com/mono/mono}{http://github.com/mono/mono}.

Here is the command to install mono:

\begin{verbatim}
    sudo apt-get install mono-complete
\end{verbatim}

Here is the command to install mcs:

\begin{verbatim}
    sudo apt-get install mcs
\end{verbatim}

On a Mac, install Homebrew first. See
\href{https://brew.sh/}{https://brew.sh/}.
Then use homebrew to install mono.  See \href{https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mono}{https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mono}.
