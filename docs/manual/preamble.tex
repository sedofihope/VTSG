The Vulnerability Test Suite Generator (VTSG) can create vast numbers of
synthetic programs with and without specific flaws or vulnerabilities.
It was designed by the Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation (SAMATE) team
and originally implemented by students from TELECOM Nancy.
The latest version is structured to be able to generate vulnerable and nonvulnerable
synthetic programs expressing specific flaws in \emph{any} programming language.
It has libraries to generate PHP, \CSharp, and Python programs.
This document may help if you are trying to generate test cases written in 
PHP, \CSharp, or Python, adding new complexities or flaws or vulnerability, or
modifying VTSG Version 3 to have new capabilities or to generate test
cases in other programming languages.
