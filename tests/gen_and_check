# Generate the requested vulnerability test suite and check the result

# VTSG produces three kinds of outputs:
#  1. the generated test cases
#  2. manifest files (lists of those cases)
#  3. a generation report: how many of what were generated
# This script runs VTSG then checks each against the expected files.
# For Python, it also executes the generated programs to make sure they are valid.

# Usage:
help_message="$ tests/gen_and_check {py,cs,php}"
